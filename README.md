This project consists of two parts: a C# API and an Angular application. The API simulates a Pokemon tournament by fetching 8 random Pokemon from the PokeAPI and calculating their wins, losses, and ties based on predefined fighting rules. The Angular app calls this API to display the results and allows sorting by various fields.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the C# API using `dotnet run`.
3. Run the Angular app using `ng serve`.
